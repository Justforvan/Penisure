  "answers": { "a1": "A condition known as micropenis may be a sign of genital association or a hormonal deficit. \nA penis that is shorter than 9.3 cm in an adult is referred to as a micropenis.\nThis is measured with the penis shaft totally stretched, measured from the tip of the glans (with the foreskin as far back as possible) to the pubic symphysis (after pressing the suprapubic fat).",
    "a2": "It is normal to masturbate, and it is essential to the development of healthy sexuality. However, frequent masturbation in a brief period of time may cause your penis to slightly swell. Talk therapy can be something to think about if the conduct turns into a compulsive one and interferes with your day-to-day activities.",
    "a3": "It is a myth. Sex can become exciting through foreplay. To make sex even more enjoyable, kissing can release hormones that help people relax and let go of their worries while with their partners. In addition to raising heart rate and lubricating the body, foreplay makes sex more enjoyable.",
    "a4": "It is natural to have some curvature to your penis when you have an erection. However, if it is uncomfortable or painful for you or your partner, particularly during sex or when masturbating, those could be symptoms of a more serious illness. Peyronie's disease is one of the types of penile curvature because scar tissue in your penis causes it to bend, curve, or lose length or girth",
    "a5": "Scientific evidence for non-surgical penis enlargement techniques is limited, and there are no reputable medical organizations that support penis surgery solely for cosmetic purposes. To add more, some penis-enlargement products can cause permanent damage to your penis",
    "a6": "A penis can \"break\" under certain conditions. Since the penis has no bone, the term \"break\" here refers to the rupture of the fibrous envelope surrounding the penis, known as tunica albuginea, which happens when a rapid, blunt force is applied to an erect penis. Usually, vaginal sex or forceful masturbation produces this force as a bending or impaction motion. You may hear a \"cracking\" sound, then experience pain and quick detumescence.",
    "a7": "Indeed, a study found that regardless of age or concomitant conditions, smokers have an even higher chance of developing erectile dysfunction.",
    "a8": "Changing positions (some positions may help to reduce the effect of stimulation), focusing on something else, meditating, using the restroom, taking a shower, waiting and relaxing, and exercising are some strategies to deal with random erections.",
    "a9": "Study revealed patients with alcohol dependence are having higher risk for sexual dysfunction.",
    "a10": "Your fertility is probably not going to be significantly affected by frequent male masturbation.\nAccording to some data, a two- to three-day period without ejaculation is required for optimal semen quality. However, additional research indicates that even with daily ejaculation, men with normal sperm quality maintain normal sperm motility and concentrations.\n",
    "a11": "A few things that can impact your fertility are: obesity, cigarette smoking, sedentary work, and infections (herpes, urinary tract, obstruction of the epididymis, and previous infections with sexually transmitted diseases)",
    "a12": "Selecting the appropriate condom is crucial. When it comes to size, too little could break, and too much could cause it to fall off. It's crucial to select the appropriate condom for your comfort level during sexual activity.\nTry to consider going up size if : \nThe base of your penis is not covered by the condom. There's nowhere to put a reservoir at the tip. It slips off. It breaks. It is incredibly tight.\nTry a smaller size if:\nThe base of your penis has an excessive amount of rolled condom. Your sensation has diminished. It slips off.\nTry a larger girth if:\nIt's uncomfortably tight.\nTry a smaller girth if:\nYour sensation has diminished. It slips off.\nConsider a thinner material:\nYour sensation has diminished. It slips off.\nTry a thicker material:\nIt breaks.\n",
    "a13": "According to the best available data, erectile dysfunction affects 52% of men in the US between the ages of 40 and 70. At least 150 million men worldwide and between 30 and 50 million men in the US are thought to suffer from erectile dysfunction. However, dueto reporting bias, cultural differences, a general lack of inquiry by many doctors regarding the sexual health of their male patients, and embarrassment issues, these values are probably a severe underestimate of the true number of men with erectile dysfunction."
